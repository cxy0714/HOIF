\item{pi}{Estimated propensity scores.}

\item{m}{Maximum order of HOIF to compute.}

\item{sample_splitting}{Logical or integer; whether to use sample splitting.}

\value{
A list containing cumulative HOIF and incremental IIFF terms for
both treatment arms.
}
\description{
Computes a sequence of higher-order influence function (HOIF) estimates
from order 2 up to order \code{m} using a brute-force implementation.
This function is **only intended for double-checking correctness** of the
main fast implementation.
}
\details{
⚠️ The computation scales combinatorially with both sample size and order
and becomes infeasible beyond very small datasets.


This routine repeatedly calls \code{compute_HOIF_test()} and accumulates
incremental influence function terms. It is not optimized and should never
be used in production or large-sample simulations.
